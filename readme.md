# Tradecycle

## Introduction
The Tradecycle website is built with a simple goal in mind : reuse waste instead of spending money recycling it. Because many industries produce waste without knowing it could be reused and integrated in production for other businesses and thus create value. The idea here is to build a platform for users and businesses to find and propose to others the waste they produce.

## Compatiblity
Tradecycle is built with *Django 3.1.1* and *python 3.8.2*, and has yet to be tested on different platforms
